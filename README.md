A Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.

Key features:
New Post: Users who are signed in should be able to write a new text-based post by filling in text into a text area and then clicking a button to submit the post.

All Posts: The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first.

Profile Page: Clicking on a username should load that user’s profile page with the following & follower count, user's posts and "Follow" & "Unfollow" button where applicable.

Following: The “Following” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they see all posts made by users that the current user follows.
Pagination: On any page that displays posts, posts should only be displayed 10 on a page. If there are more than ten posts, a “Next” button should appear to take the user to the next page of posts (which should be older than the current page of posts). If not on the first page, a “Previous” button should appear to take the user to the previous page of posts as well.

Edit Post: Users should be able to click an “Edit” button or link on any of their own posts to edit that post. This is achieved using JavaScript without requiring a reload of the entire page.

“Like” and “Unlike”: Users should be able to click a button or link on any post to toggle whether or not they “like” that post. This is achieved using fetch calls without requiring a reload of the entire page.
